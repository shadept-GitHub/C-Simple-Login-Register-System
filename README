So I recently began to learn C++ and this is a project that I made to learn and practice.
This would definitely be not possible without the help of Admer and Windawz.
Of course the code won't be clean as what do you expect from someone who has never made a true C++ project before with quite little knowledge on the language?


P.S: I've compiled this only with Visual Studio 2019 on Windows 10, so yeah.
